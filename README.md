## YouApp Frontend Developer Recruitment Test

This project is structured and developed using Next.js 13 using react structure best practice and Atomic Design methodology. slicing figma design to react code with atension to detail, im proud to deliver this project to you as my submision test.

#### This image show a brief look how i slicing the design to code.

## Introduction

This project showcases a frontend implementation for YouApp using the principles of Atomic Design. Atomic Design is a methodology for creating design systems that decompose the user interface into smaller, reusable components.

## Atomic Design Methodology

Atomic Design divides the UI into five distinct levels:

1. **Atoms**: Basic building blocks of matter, such as buttons, inputs, labels.
2. **Molecules**: Groups of atoms bonded together, e.g., a form label, input, and button.
3. **Organisms**: Complex UI components composed of molecules and atoms, e.g., a header or a card.
4. **Templates**: Page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design's content structure.
5. **Pages**: Specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real content.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
