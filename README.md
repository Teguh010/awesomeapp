## Atomic Design Methodology

Atomic Design divides the UI into five distinct levels:

1. **Atoms**: Basic building blocks of matter, such as buttons, inputs, labels.
2. **Molecules**: Groups of atoms bonded together, e.g., a form label, input, and button.
3. **Organisms**: Complex UI components composed of molecules and atoms, e.g., a header or a card.
4. **Templates**: Page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design's content structure.
5. **Pages**: Specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real content.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
